source  >  build  > test  > prod

Source: This is the point where you check in source code.

Build: Compile code, unit test, create artifacts

Test: integration test with other systems,load testing, ui test, penerate testing

Prod: Deployment to production environment.

Source and build stages are combinedly termed as continuous integration

continuous delivery is the whole ci and artifact tested in test 
and there is a manual intervention to move code into prod.

Continuous Deployment: is the process where no human intervention needed and code gets deployed automatically.





Sample python code:

from flask import flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello-World!"


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0")
