What is the difference between shell module and command line module?
A)  The shell is user interface to access the services of an operating system where as CLI - 
command line interface is a computer program that processes commands in the form of line of text. 
The user typically interacts with shell via command line interface

What is host-key-checking?
Checking host keys guards against server spoofing and man in the middle attacks. 
when ever the host reinstalls and has a different keys in Known_hosts then error occurs until it get corrected.

What is Ansible role?
Ansible roles allow you to develop reusable automation components by grouping and encapsulating related 
artifacts, like configuration files, templates, tasks, and handlers.
To get the role ansible-galaxy init <rolename>
the above command creates the role.
for example ltes say we created a role with rolename post install it creates the following

post install
    Readme.md
    defaults
        main.yaml
    files
    handlers
        main.yaml
    meta
        main.yaml
    tasks
        main.yaml
    templates
    tests
        inventory
        test.yaml
    vars
        main.yaml

What are handlers in ansible?
Handlers are the tasks that they run only when notified.    
Sometimes you want a task to run only when a change is made on a machine. 
For example, you may want to restart a service if a task updates the configuration of that service, 
but not if the configuration is unchanged. Ansible uses handlers to address this use case. 
Handlers are tasks that only run when notified.

What are the modules used in ansible?
copy
file
fetch
debug

Order of ansible configuration
    ANSIBLE_CONFIG(if environment variable is set by exporting and defining path) - 1st priority
    ansible.cfg (in current working directory) - 2nd priority
    ~/.ansible.cfg(in the home directory) - 3rd priority
    /etc/ansible/hosts (global) - last priority
    if we are using ansible > 2.12 we should generate a configuration file by using command
    $  ansible-config init --disabled > ansible.cfg

what is Ansible inventory?
The Ansible inventory file defines the hosts and groups of hosts upon 
which commands, modules, and tasks in a playbook operate. The common format of ansible inventory is yaml.
 The default location for the inventory file is /etc/ansible/hosts.
 sample ansible inventory file
 [all:vars]

 ansible_connection = ssh

 [test]    # group
 test1  ansible_host=remote_host ansible_user=remote_user ansible_private_key_file=/path/to/file
