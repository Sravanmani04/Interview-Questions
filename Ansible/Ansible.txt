What is the difference between shell module and command line module?
A)  The shell is user interface to access the services of an operating system where as CLI - 
command line interface is a computer program that processes commands in the form of line of text. 
The user typically interacts with shell via command line interface

What is host-key-checking?
Checking host keys guards against server spoofing and man in the middle attacks. 
when ever the host reinstalls and has a different keys in Known_hosts then error occurs until it get corrected.
with removing the old one ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/known_hosts -R <host ip>
and update with ssh-keyscan -r rsa <hostip> >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts

What is Ansible role?
Ansible roles allow you to develop reusable automation components by grouping and encapsulating related 
artifacts, like configuration files, templates, tasks, and handlers.
To get the role ansible-galaxy init <rolename>
the above command creates the role.
for example ltes say we created a role with rolename post install it creates the following

post install
    Readme.md
    defaults
        main.yaml
    files
    handlers
        main.yaml
    meta
        main.yaml
    tasks
        main.yaml
    templates
    tests
        inventory
        test.yaml
    vars
        main.yaml

What are handlers in ansible?
Handlers are the tasks that they run only when notified.    
Sometimes you want a task to run only when a change is made on a machine. 
For example, you may want to restart a service if a task updates the configuration of that service, 
but not if the configuration is unchanged. Ansible uses handlers to address this use case. 
Handlers are tasks that only run when notified.

What are the modules used in ansible?
copy
file
fetch
debug

Order of ansible configuration
    ANSIBLE_CONFIG(if environment variable is set by exporting and defining path) - 1st priority
    ansible.cfg (in current working directory) - 2nd priority
    ~/.ansible.cfg(in the home directory) - 3rd priority
    /etc/ansible/hosts (global) - last priority
    if we are using ansible > 2.12 we should generate a configuration file by using command
    $  ansible-config init --disabled > ansible.cfg

what is Ansible inventory?
The Ansible inventory file defines the hosts and groups of hosts upon 
which commands, modules, and tasks in a playbook operate. The common format of ansible inventory is yaml.
 The default location for the inventory file is /etc/ansible/hosts.
 sample ansible inventory file
 [all:vars]

 ansible_connection = ssh

 [test]    # group
 test1  ansible_host=remote_host ansible_user=remote_user ansible_private_key_file=/path/to/file

what are adhoc commands in ansible?
Ansible ad hoc command uses the /usr/bin/ansible command-line tool to automate 
a single task on one or more managed nodes.
The default module for the ansible command-line utility is the ansible.builtin.command module.
Use cases for ad hoc tasks

Rebooting servers
I can use adhoc commands  to call command module and reboot all servers inatlanta, 10 at a time.
For that i have to list all servers of altlanta and group them under [atlanta] in my inventory file.
I must have working ssh credentials for that group.
To generate and copy keys
$ ssh-keygen   # generates public and private keys.
the keys gets stored under ~/.ssh
public key has read permissions for user, groups and others and user also has write permission
private key has read write permissions set only for user 
the keys can be copied in two ways:
using ssh-copy-id:
 $ ssh-copy-id remote_user@host # it stores the keys at $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys.
can configure manually by copying files from host to $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys on remote hosts.
then after use this command 

ansible atlanta -a "/sbin/reboot"

To reboot the [atlanta] servers with 10 parallel forks:
$ ansible atlanta -a "/sbin/reboot" -f 10

/usr/bin/ansible will default to running from your user account. To connect as a different user:
$ ansible atlanta -a "/sbin/reboot" -f 10 -u username


Managing files:
Copying files:
ansible atlanta -m ansible.builtin.copy -a "src=/etc/hosts dest=/tmp/hosts"

changing ownership and permissions on files:
$ ansible webservers -m ansible.builtin.file -a "dest=/srv/foo/a.txt mode=600"
$ ansible webservers -m ansible.builtin.file -a "dest=/srv/foo/b.txt mode=600 owner=mdehaan group=mdehaan"

The file module can also create directories, similar to mkdir -p:
$ ansible webservers -m ansible.builtin.file -a "dest=/path/to/c mode=755 owner=mdehaan group=mdehaan state=directory"

Delete files:
$ ansible webservers -m ansible.builtin.file -a "dest=/path/to/c state=absent"

Managing packages:
To ensure a package is installed without updating it:

$ ansible webservers -m ansible.builtin.yum -a "name=acme state=present"
To ensure a specific version of a package is installed:

$ ansible webservers -m ansible.builtin.yum -a "name=acme-1.5 state=present"
To ensure a package is at the latest version:

$ ansible webservers -m ansible.builtin.yum -a "name=acme state=latest"
To ensure a package is not installed:

$ ansible webservers -m ansible.builtin.yum -a "name=acme state=absent"

Managing users and groups
You can create, manage, and remove user accounts on your managed nodes with ad hoc tasks:

$ ansible all -m ansible.builtin.user -a "name=foo password=<crypted password here>"

$ ansible all -m ansible.builtin.user -a "name=foo state=absent"
