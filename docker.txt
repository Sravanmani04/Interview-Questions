what is a docker-swarm cluster?
A Docker Swarm is a group of either physical or virtual machines that are running the Docker application

The activities of the cluster are controlled by a swarm manager, and machines that have joined 
the cluster are referred to as nodes.
One of the key benefits associated with the operation of a docker swarm is the 
high level of availability offered for applications.
Docker Swarm lets you connect containers to multiple hosts similar to Kubernetes.

What is the difference between cmd and entrypoint?
Entrypoint has the higher priority than cmd.
cmd - where we give the command that starts the container process
from ubuntu:latest
cmd ["echo", "hello"]
when ever i run the image it gives hello message
from ubuntu:latest
entrypoint ["echo"]
    if i build this image and run it just runs echo and prints nothing and if i pass an argument 
    after docker run containername hello it prints hello
it says that if you see an image that entrypoint has command and no argument, user has to pass the argument
the arguments passed to entrypoints that appends it to the command
from ubuntu:latest
entrypoint ["echo"]
cmd ["hello"]
if i build this image and run it prints hello, entry point runs first and takes cmd as argument
here i can override the cmd and pass the argument to cmd dynamically through cli.

What are bind mounts?
When you use a bind mount, a file or directory on the host machine is mounted into a container.
The file or directory is referenced by its absolute path on the host machine. 
By contrast, when you use a volume, a new directory is created within Docker’s storage directory on 
the host machine, and Docker manages that directory’s contents.
