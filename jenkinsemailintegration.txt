In this section we'll learn how to integrate Jenkins with Email using AWS SES & GMail.

Having notifications via Email is quite useful, because if any Job fails, then Jenkins is going to notify you.

For this in jenkins download mailer plugin 
MANAGEPLUGINS->Available->search"Mailer plugin"

Integrate AWS SES with jenkins

login to aws-> aws ses-> verify domain or Email
verify email with aws

Now configure jenkins to ses
managejenkins->configuresystem->email notification ->
Provide these details 
smtp server     # get this from smtp settings of aws ses
port            # get this from smtp settings of aws ses  25,465 or 587
username        # create smtp credentials from iam
password        # create smtp credentials from iam
use ssl         # chek box
reply to address # our email
before testing configuration in jenkins goto 
jenkins location >  systemadmin email address > give our email
now test configuartion this sends an email to our email as test

above procedure is same instead change smtpserver 
enable 2 step verification 
under app passwords 
create custom name generate password and 
provide this generated token as password to gmail password
test configuration now 
it works

Integrating notifications to our jobs


After the above configuration done, in jenkins under post-build actions
postbuildactions> emailnotification> send emails for every unstable build, 
send seperate emails to individuals who broke build
check box above notifications
